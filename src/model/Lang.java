/*
    This class defines a single language. This app can hold many languages.

    per language, use a nested dictionary data structure to keep track of words, translations and definitions.
    {word : {translation : definition & examples}}
    idea is that one word may have many different translations. for e.g: æœˆ in japanese can mean "moon" or "month"

    definition does not have to be re-written per language. This can be abstracted out into another class (Definition)
